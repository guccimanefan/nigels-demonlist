  // ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  // SCORING
  // A 100% completion of the #1 (highest-rated) demon is worth `topScore`.
  // Everything else falls off exponentially by gdladder difficulty `rating`
  // (in data/demons.js):
  //
  //     points(rating) = topScore * base ^ (rating - topRating)
  //
  // The curve shape is fit to the AREDL (aredl.net) so the list is as
  // top-heavy as GD demons really are: `base` 1.176 means each -1.0 of rating
  // divides points by ~1.18, and a ~6.5-point rating gap is worth ~2.9x. So
  // Ghoul (rating 30.45) = 500 and Bloodbath (23.98) ~= 175 - the same
  // proportions as their real AREDL points. There's no floor: every demon
  // scores what its rating earns, so a harder easy-demon still beats a softer
  // one (End Line 1.99 -> ~5.0 vs The Nightmare 1.04 -> ~4.2). Raise `base`
  // for a steeper list, lower it for a flatter one. Scoring function:
  // DL.scoreAt100 in static/js/list-utils.js.
  // ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  scoring: {
    // Points for a 100% of the #1 demon.

    // Flat points for a (100%) completion of any Legacy demon (no Legacy tier
    // right now - see extendedListSize above).
    legacyScore: 2,
    // A completion at exactly a demon's requirement% is worth this fraction of
    // its 100%-score; completions between requirement% and 100% are
